Predictive Analytics using Machine Learning in Python - Predicting  Insurance Claims

This project, conducted during my MSc in Data Analytics, applied various data analytics techniques to address real-world business problems. I developed a predictive model for retail sales trends using linear regression, optimized product quality in a manufacturing setting through statistical methods like ANOVA and t-tests, and built a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The models achieved high predictive accuracy, providing valuable insights for business decision-making. The project emphasizes the integration of data analytics and machine learning to improve business operations across industries.
