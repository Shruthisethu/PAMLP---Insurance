Predictive Analytics using Machine Learning in Python - Predicting  Insurance Claims

Developed a predictive model using machine learning techniques to assess claim frequency in the automobile insurance industry. The project involved handling a large, imbalanced dataset and applying Random Forest Classifier to predict the likelihood of insurance claims. The model achieved 98% accuracy by identifying key features that influence claim filings, optimizing resource allocation, and detecting potential fraud.


This project has been created and executed using Google Colabs.
